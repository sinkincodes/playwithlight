Diffraction with a Single Slit

\begin_layout Section
Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Single slit diffraction demonstrates the wave-particle duality of light.
 Depending on both the wavelength of the light and the width of the slit,
 interference patterns with peaks of different amplitudes are formed at
 angle 
\begin_inset Formula $sin(\delta\theta)=\frac{\lambda}{d}$
\end_inset

 apart, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 describes the width of the slit.
 Depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, small angle approximation might be used.

Brief description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general He-NE laser with a narrow waveband 632.8 nm is used to approximate
 a monochromatic source.
 Ideally, a prism or a spatial filter is used in order to reduce the aberration
 of the source.
 We omit the source cleaning procedure in this lab since the quality of
 our light source is good.
 The laser beam passes through the first filter to coarsely filter the source.
 The light then passes through another filter with narrower width such that
 we get our final diffraction pattern on the viewing screen or the photon
 detector.
 The viewing screen or the photo detector is installed on the right-end
 of the table such that the diffracted angle can be measured more precisely,
 under the assumption that our source is close to a monochromatic source.

Verify that whether we do need the first slit or not.

Equipment 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HeNe laser; Calibration tool; Optical Breadboard Table; Optical filter or
 prism on appropriate holders with micro-adjustment; Coarse slit on a film;
 Fine, variable slit (around 100 Î¼m); viewing screen; Photo Detector with
 a coarse slit installed in front.

\begin_layout Subsection
Setup 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the length limitation of the table, we install the laser on the
 far left-end of the table.
 Calibration of the laser then need to be done both vertically and then
 horizontally, according to manual, or use the ThorLab alignment tool.
 First slit should be installed perpendicular to the light path around 30cm
 away from the source.
 The second slit should then follow closely at around 3-5cm away.
 Place the viewing screen on the far right end of the table such that we
 measure

Error Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The uncertainties come from the width of laser, the width of the slit, distance
 between the slit and the detector/ viewing screen, the transverse length
 the detector has moved, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data Analysis Bandwidth theorem is used, referring to Lab Manual of optical
 pumping experiment.
 We combine this into our calculation.
